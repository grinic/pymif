PyMIF documentation
===================

**PyMIF** is a modular Python package to read, visualize, and write multiscale (pyramidal) 
microscopy image data from a variety of microscope platforms available at the 
`Mesoscopic Imaging Facility (MIF) <https://www.embl.org/groups/mesoscopic-imaging-facility>`_ 
into the `OME-NGFF (Zarr) <https://ngff.openmicroscopy.org/)>`_ format.
